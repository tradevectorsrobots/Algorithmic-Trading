1. EBIT = Earnings before income and taxes
COGS = cost of goods sold

EBIT also known as = Operating profit = Operating Earning = Operating Income.
Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) is an indicator of a company's profitability.

1.	If EBIT is unsatisfactory - company will either need to increase its revenue, decrease its expenses or both to improve its performance.
2.	Investors uses EBIT to compare the profitability of one company to another, when they do not want to factor in companies’ different capital structures and different tax rates.
3.	While calculating EBIT, important to note what is the standard for that industry.
4.	EBIT also used within same company to compare performance periodically (last year or previous years).
5.	EBIT also an input to calculate various other financial calculations.

6.	Formula and Calculation for EBIT 
EBIT = Revenue − COGS − Operating Expenses
Or
EBIT = Net Income + Interest + Taxes

Example:

Ron’s Lawn Care Equipment and Supply company manufacturers tractors for commercial use. This year his income statement reports the following activities:
•	Sales: $1,000,000
•	CGS: $650,000
•	Gross Profit: $350,000
•	Operating Expenses: $200,000
•	Interest Expense: $50,000
•	Income Taxes: $10,000
•	Net Income: $90,000
In this example, Ron’s company earned a profit of $90,000 for the year. In order to calculate our EBIT ratio, we must add the interest and tax expense back in. Thus, Ron’s EBIT for the year equals $150,000.
$150,000 = $90,000 + $50,000 + $10,000
This means that Ron has $150,000 of profits left over after all of the cost of goods sold and operating expenses have been paid for the year. This $150,000 left over is available to pay interest, taxes, investors, or pay down debt.

2. EBITDA: Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.

1.	Measure of a company's operating performance.
2.	It’s a profitability calculation that measures how profitable a company is before paying interest to creditors, taxes to the government, and taking paper expenses like depreciation and amortization.
3.	Calculated by adding back the non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization to a firm's operating income (EBIT).
4.	EBITDA allows investors to focus on operating profitability as a singular measure of performance.
5.	Such analysis is particularly important when comparing similar companies across a single industry, or companies operating in different tax brackets.
EBITDA = Net Income + Interest + Taxes + Depreciation + Amortization.
OR
             EBITDA = Revenue – (Salaries + Rent + Utilities + COGS).

6.	EBITDA is a measure of how much cash came in the door, EBITDA margin is a measure of how much cash profit a company made in a year relative to its total sales before all taxes and interest paid.
EBITDA Margin = EBITDA / Total Revenues.
Example
Let’s look at an example and calculate both the adjusted EBITDA and margin for Jake’s Ski House. Jake manufactures custom skis for both pro and amateur skiers. At the end of the year, Jake earned $100,000 in total revenues and had the following expenses.
•	Salaries: $25,000
•	Rent: $10,000
•	Utilities: $4,000
•	Cost of Goods Sold: $35,000
•	Interest: $5,000
•	Depreciation: $15,000
•	Taxes: $3,000
Jake’s net income at the end of the year equals $3,000.
EBITDA = $3000 (net income) + $5000 (interest) + $3000 (taxes) + $15000 (Depreciation) + $0 (amortization).
EBITDA = $26,000

Conversely, you can also compute EBITDA by subtracting out all expenses other than interest, taxes, and depreciation like this:
EBITDA = Revenue – (Salaries + Rent + Utilities + COGS).
              = $1,00,000 – ($25,000 + $10,000 + $4,000 + $35000)
              = $26,000
EBITDA Margin = $26,000 / $1,00,000 = 0.26$ (26 cents) in % terms its 26%
The EBITDA margin ratio shows that every dollar Jake generates in revenues results in 26 cents of profits before all taxes and interest is paid. This % can be used to compare Jake’s efficiency and profitability to other companies regardless of size.

3. EBITDA Coverage Ratio: 

1.	Used as solvency ratio.
2.	EBITDA coverage ratio measures a company's ability to pay off liabilities such as debts and lease payments.
EBITDA to Coverage Ratio = (EBITDA + Lease Payments) / (Interest Payments + Principal Payments + Lease Payments)
3.	If a company's EBITDA coverage ratio is equal to or greater than 1, it indicates that the firm is in a better position to pay off its obligations. 
4.	Higher the EBITDA coverage ratio, the better able the company is to repay its liabilities.  The lower the EBITDA coverage ratio, the harder it will be for a company to repay its obligations.

. 4. Times Interest Earned Ratio: is an indicator of a company’s ability to pay off its interest expense with available earnings. It calculates how many times a company’s operating income (earnings before interest and taxes) can settle the company’s interest expense. A higher times interest earned ratio indicates that the company’s interest expense is low relative to its earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) which indicates better long-term financial strength, and vice versa.

Times Interest Earned = Earnings before Interest and Tax (EBIT) / Interest Expense
Example
Following are excerpts from their balance sheets and income statements:
	Company A	Company B
Total liabilities	15 million	30 million
Total assets	30 million	40 million
Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)	2.5 million	2 million
Interest expense	1 million	1.5 million
We can assess the solvency of the companies by calculating and comparing debt ratio and times interest earned ratio for both the companies, which are as follows:
Debt ratio of Company A = 15 million/30 million = 0.50
Debt ratio of Company B = 30 million/40 million = 0.75
Times interest earned ratio of Company A = 2.5 million/1 million = 2.5
Times interest earned ratio of Company B = 2 million/1.5 million = 1.33
Conclusion: The ratios indicate that Company A has better financial position than Company B

Exercise: 
A company reports sales revenue of $1,000,000. Salary expenses are reported as $250,000, while utilities are reported as $20,000. Lease payments are $100,000. The company also reports depreciation of $50,000 and interest expenses of $120,000and operating profit margins, 
Calculate the EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio.
(Hint / steps - calculate EBIT, EBITDA, then calculate EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio).
